# Stream Operator

| **Operator**         | **Description**                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `map(fn)`            | Transforms each value emitted by the stream using a given function.                |
| `flatMap(fn)`        | Maps each value to a new stream and merges all results into a single stream.       |
| `merge(...streams)`  | Combines multiple streams into one, emitting values from all as they arrive.       |
| `concat(...streams)` | Runs multiple streams in sequence — each starts after the previous one completes.  |
| `concatMap(fn)`      | Maps each value to a new stream and processes them sequentially, preserving order. |
| `filter(fn)`         | Emits only the values that meet the specified condition.                           |
